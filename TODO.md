  - When a wrong input value is provided, the input plugs in 'undefined' as a string.
  - Placeholders not really working well (not sure its related to custom masks)

- Build

  - Typescript generating too many files

- Test suite

  - Low code coverage, should be 75 procent
  - Missing tests on custom masks
